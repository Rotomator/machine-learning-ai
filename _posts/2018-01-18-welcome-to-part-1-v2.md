  Welcome to v2 of Deep Learning Part 1! We are currently doing a "soft launch"
  of the course videos. Feel free to discuss and share amongst your friends, but
  don't post the videos to high volume sites like twitter, HN, reddit, etc until
  we launch officially - since I want new people to get the best possible
  experience.
