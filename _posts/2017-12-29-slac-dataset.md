  This project presents a novel video dataset, named SLAC (Sparsely Labeled
  ACtions), for action recognition and localization. It consists of over 520K
  untrimmed videos and 1.75M clip annotations spanning 200 action categories.
  Using our proposed framework, annotating a video clip takes merely 8.8 seconds
  on average, representing a saving in labeling time of over 95% compared to the
  traditional procedure of manual trimming and localization of actions.
