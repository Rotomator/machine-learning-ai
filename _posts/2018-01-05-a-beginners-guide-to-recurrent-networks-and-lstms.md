  Contents The purpose of this post is to give students of neural networks an
  intuition about the functioning of recurrent neural networks and purpose and
  structure of a prominent RNN variation, LSTMs. Recurrent nets are a type of
  artificial neural network designed to recognize patterns in sequences of data,
  such as text, genomes, handwriting, the spoken word, or numerical times series
  data emanating from sensors, stock markets and government agencies.
