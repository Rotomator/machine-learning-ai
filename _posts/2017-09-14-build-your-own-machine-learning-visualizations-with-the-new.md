  When we open-sourced TensorFlow in 2015, it included TensorBoard, a suite of
  visualizations for inspecting and understanding your TensorFlow models and
  runs. Tensorboard included a small, predetermined set of visualizations that
  are generic and applicable to nearly all deep learning applications such as
  observing how loss changes over time or exploring clusters in high-dimensional
  spaces.
