  This tutorial is intended for someone who wants to understand how Recurrent
  Neural Network works, no prior knowledge about RNN is required. We will
  implement the most simple RNN model - Elman Recurrent Neural Network. To get a
  better understanding of RNNs, we will build it from scratch using Pytorch
  tensor package and autograd library.
