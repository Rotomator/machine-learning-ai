  Object detection is a domain that has benefited immensely from the recent
  developments in deep learning. Recent years have seen people develop many
  algorithms for object detection, some of which include YOLO, SSD, Mask RCNN
  and RetinaNet. For the past few months, I've been working on improving object
  detection at a research lab.
