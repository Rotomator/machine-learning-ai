  The year is coming to an end. I did not write nearly as much as I had planned
  to. But I'm hoping to change that next year, with more tutorials around
  Reinforcement Learning, Evolution, and Bayesian Methods coming to WildML! And
  what better way to start than with a summary of all the amazing things that
  happened in 2017?
